          'Finnish government renounces racism after a summer rocked by racist scandals',
      text:
          '''Members of the four-party right-wing coalition claim they are all now on board with new measures to fight discrimination and racism.
The Finnish government unveiled a new plan Thursday to try and shake off the stigma of racism that has marred the first months of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo's right-wing coalition government.
The plan is aimed at combating racism and anti-Semitism, including a new law to criminalise Holocaust denial and plans to possibly ban Nazi and Communist symbols – although that could prove legally difficult.
"Every minister in the government renounces racism and is committed to actively combating it", Orpo told a press conference in Helsinki, where leaders pledged up to €1.5 million to bring in the 23 measures outlined in the plan.
The government was pushed into action only after it was rocked by repeated scandals since forming in June.
Rikka Purra, finance minister, and leader of the far-right Finns Party, had to apologise for past racist comments she made online after being condemned by her government colleagues.
The incendiary words she shared in 2008, particularly against immigration, Islam and racism, as well as threats of violence, have resurfaced. In June, another Finns Party minister, Vilhelm Junnila, announced his resignation after holding on to the economy portfolio for just 10 days, following an outcry over earlier comments favourable to the Nazis, and racist positions calling on African women to have more abortions to combat the climate crisis.
During the last legislative campaign, Junnila joked about his candidate number, 88, a number used by neo-Nazi groups to mark their allegiance to Hitler.
Junnila's replacement as economy minister, Wille Rydman, was also caught up in a racist scandal after Finland's main newspaper published messages he had sent to a former girlfriend.
In them, Rydman suggested that Somalis spread like weeds, and shared lyrics to a song apparently penned by another Finns Party MP whose lyrics talked about a Muslim who leaves his home country and rapes a woman. Rydman suggested to his ex-girlfriend that the song could be ideally sung at student parties.
Minister Rydman complained about headscarves that some Muslim women wear, and described people from the Middle East as "monkeys" and "desert monkeys."
Other Finns Party ministers had to clarify their positions on the ethno-nationalist 'Great Replacement' theory, which they had previously seemed to support. The false conspiracy theory posits that white Europeans will be replaced by foreigners, especially Muslims, and quickly become a minority in their own countries.
The speaker of the Finnish parliament, also a Finns Party MP, has a decades-long history of writing racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments online. He and other Finns Party MPs have convictions for racist comments or writings.
 Scandals triggered tensions within coalition government
The ongoing scandals triggered major tensions within the four-party coalition government, leading to clashes in particular between the previously moderate and socially liberal Swedish People's Party (SFP), and the far-right populist Finns Party.
The Swedish People's Party had demanded apologies from all the Finns Party ministers caught up in racist comments, but none were forthcoming.
Repeated pronouncements from the party's leader Anna-Maja Henriksson that SFP had zero tolerance towards racism began to sound hollow when they were trotted out repeatedly over the summer, as each new racist scandal unfolded.
Today she hailed the new anti-discrimination plan as "historic."
"The communication is a clear indication that the government does not accept racism of any kind, and confirms that the government and all its ministers are committed to active anti-racism work and the promotion of equality and non-discrimination," she said in a statement Thursday.
SFP, with 10 members of parliament, has the power to collapse the government if it wants, but after some protestations and wavering, it appears to have chosen to remain in power.
However, next week will see the Finnish Parliament hold votes of confidence in both Riikka Purra and Wille Rydman, called by the opposition Left Alliance and Greens.
If the SFP's MPs do not support both Purra and Rydman, then the government will likely fall.''',

          'Finns flock abroad: Summer travel almost returns to pre-pandemic levels',
      text:
          '''The summer of 2023 witnessed a resurgence of international leisure travel by Finns, nearly reaching the levels observed before the coronavirus pandemic. Between May and August, approximately 2.9 million overseas trips were taken, of which 2.6 million were overnight stays, while the remaining 0.3 million were day trips or cruises.
Travel to Estonia mirrored pre-pandemic levels, with the country receiving around 0.7 million Finnish leisure travelers from May to August.
Additionally, travel to neighboring Sweden saw a significant uptick.
"Interest in overseas travel surged during the summer of 2022 when travel restrictions were relaxed. By the summer of 2023, international travel grew even more, with many Finns venturing further into Europe," noted Marianne Laalo, Chief Statistician at the Statistics Centre.
Sunny Southern Europe was a major attraction, drawing one in every four international leisure trips by Finns. The region observed a 25% increase in visits compared to the previous summer.
Greece and Spain stood out as the most preferred destinations in the south. Travel to both nations exceeded the numbers from the summer before and even surpassed the summer of 2019. In total, around half a million trips were made to Greece and Spain during the summer of 2023.
Long-haul trips, those lasting over three nights, increased by over 20%, with package tours constituting nearly one-fifth of these journeys.
On the domestic front, however, there was a noticeable decline in travel. Overnight leisure trips within the country totaled 9.7 million from May to August, marking a consecutive annual drop. The number of domestic trips plummeted by 25% compared to the peak year of 2021, which recorded around 13 million overnight leisure trips.
The decline in domestic travel can be attributed to the dwindling numbers of visits to relatives and friends, as well as a drop in cottage stays. Overnight stays related to domestic leisure trips also saw a reduction.
"Cottage stays had already decreased in the summer of 2022, and in 2023, they dropped by another fifth from the previous year. However, the number of stays in hotels and rental cottages during May to August remained roughly on par with the previous summer," Laalo elaborated.''',

          'Digital euro and mobile instant payment solution: A secure future for Europe\'s digitizing economy',
      text:
          '''Amidst the decline of cash usage, the need for households to retain the ability to pay with central bank money in an increasingly digital society is of paramount importance, states Tuomas Välimäki, a member of both the Board of Finland's Central Bank (Suomen Pankki) and the European Central Bank's Council (EKP).
Actively spearheading the development of new payment methods, Suomen Pankki has identified two prevailing themes shaping the future of transactions: the harnessing of digital technology and the move towards real-time settlements.
Consumers now anticipate payments that are efficient, user-friendly, and instantaneous.
Currently, the European payment landscape is buzzing with discussions about the digital euro, envisioned as an adjunct to cash. This digital counterpart not only bolsters Europe's strategic independence in daily transactions but also stimulates competition within the eurozone.
Throughout its two-year exploratory phase, which concludes this month, the euro system has made significant determinations regarding the digital euro's features. Resembling physical banknotes, the digital euro would represent a liability of the central bank to the public, and its distribution would be facilitated via banks and payment institutions. "The adoption of the digital euro would grant consumers the ability to pay with central bank money anywhere electronic payments are possible. In essence, consumers could execute transactions similarly to current electronic payments," elaborates Välimäki.
The council of the European Central Bank, in its meeting on 18th October 2023, resolved to advance the digital euro project. Now entering a two-year preparatory phase, this move is a tangible step closer to a scenario where the euro system could, if desired, introduce digital euros into circulation. However, a final decision on its issuance remains a matter for the future.
Parallel to this, under the aegis of the payment council, Suomen Pankki is steering the birth of a Finnish mobile instant payment solution, compatible at the European level. The evolution of instant transfers based on account balances aims to intensify retail payment competition, ensuring operational reliability, and offering an equitable payment method abiding by uniform principles and terms.
"A goal of Suomen Pankki is to incorporate a mobile instant payment solution that operates independently of payment cards into commonly used payment methods," states Välimäki.
Ensuring the trustworthiness of the payment and financial system is within Suomen Pankki's purview. A crucial aspect of this trust is the resilience of the financial sector against cyber threats. While the sector's current defense against cyber threats stands commendably, ongoing enhancements are essential to counter evolving risks. Suomen Pankki is committed to fortifying the entire payment and financial system's resilience.
In Finland, preparations for the continuity of society's critical functions are comprehensive and routine. Businesses frequently strategize for continuity and preparedness to safeguard operations. This individual preparedness is further bolstered by mutual coordination and shared precautionary measures, encompassing single entities, entire industries, and inter-agency cooperation.
The euro system's cyber strategy serves as a pivotal framework, equipping defenses against cyber threats across various levels with appropriate tools.''',

          'Finnish Immigration streamlines student residency with automated approvals',
      text:
          '''In a move to accelerate and standardize the processing of student residence permits, the Finnish Immigration Service initiated a pilot program on 19 October 2023, introducing automated decision-making into its workflow.
The innovative system is set to fast-track applications that fulfill every criterion for the issuance of the permit.
It promises a smoother and more efficient procedure for applicants, cutting down the wait time significantly. The agency's objective is to bring down the average processing duration for employed individuals and students to a mere month.
Deputy Director-General Elina Immonen believes that this step towards modernization will promote "safe and seamless immigration." By automating the standard processing, specialists at the Immigration Service will have more time to dedicate to applications that require specialized attention or need further details.
Initially, this automated procedure is being tested on applications from degree-seeking students at Finnish universities and all exchange students. Depending on the pilot's success, the service plans to expand the automated system to cater to other applicant groups in the future.
What sets this automation system apart is its rigorous verification process. It adheres to the same stringent standards applied when an official reviews an application manually. Furthermore, applicants must have their identity verified either at a Finnish mission or a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. If any inconsistencies arise or additional information is required, an official steps in to review and make the decision.
In recent times, the Finnish Immigration Service has already been leveraging automation, particularly for vetting records maintained by public authorities. As of 28 September, the agency also began automated post-permit issuance surveillance for student residence permits. New general legislation enacted in May has facilitated this shift towards automated decision-making, especially in straightforward cases where permits are issued as per the application without involving third parties, like family members.
Anna Cheung, Chief Digital Officer, sheds light on the agency's long-standing commitment to automation, aiming to bolster both decision-making and post-decision scrutiny. She emphasizes that while automation will enhance efficiency, certain vital steps, like the verification of the applicant's identity and the scrutiny of register checks, will remain under official oversight, ensuring the highest levels of security.''',

          'Survey reveals a skills gap: 39% of firms dissatisfied with professional competence of graduates',
      text:
          '''A recent survey by the Chamber of Commerce suggests that almost four in ten businesses (39%) believe the skills of professionally trained graduates do not align with workplace requirements. This alarming figure highlights an urgent issue, as the greatest deficiency flagged by firms pertains to the lack of professionals with the right vocational qualifications.
Of the companies surveyed, 31% rated the expertise of graduates as poor in meeting work demands, while 8% found it very inadequate.
On the optimistic side, 21% of the respondents believed that the skills matched or exceeded job needs well.
The survey specifically targeted companies in need of individuals who have completed secondary vocational education.
Johanna Sipola, Deputy Director-General of the Central Chamber of Commerce, voiced her concerns, stating, "Our surveys indicate that businesses are in dire need of professionals with vocational education. The equation doesn't add up if we cannot cater to these needs with contemporary, high-caliber skills. This deterioration in vocational competence constrains the growth of Finnish companies and hampers their competitive edge on the global stage."
In order to ensure the availability of skilled labor, businesses spotlighted three key solutions:
Enhancing collaboration between companies and educational institutions, deemed important or very important by 92% of businesses.
Revamping curriculum content to better reflect workplace needs, supported by 90% of companies.
Overhauling incentives for job acceptance, endorsed by 80% of firms.
The Central Chamber of Commerce emphasized the importance of educational institutions adapting autonomously to changing demands, suggesting they should adjust the curriculum, initiate new training programs, or offer concise skill modules.
"For narrowing the gap between vocational skills and workplace needs, we must streamline the regulation of educational responsibilities and capacities. We need an ongoing dialogue between enterprises and vocational players to make education more attuned to workplace demands," added Sipola.
Furthermore, 67% of firms claimed to have a thorough understanding of local vocational institutions and their offerings, while a mere 9% felt they were ill-informed. Encouragingly, 42% expressed satisfaction with the collaborative efforts.
According to the survey, the demand for trained professionals is notably concentrated in specific sectors: engineering (74%), commerce, administration, and legal studies (73%), IT and telecommunications (65%), and the service industry.
Sipola pointed out a significant omission in the survey's coverage. "The healthcare and social sectors are grappling with a worsening labor shortage. Due to the membership structure of the Chambers of Commerce, this area is underrepresented in the survey," she commented.''',

      title: '22 heroic dogs honored for saving human lives',
      text:
          '''In a heartwarming celebration of the special bond between humans and dogs, the Finnish Kennel Club, is set to award 22 courageous canines with the 'Sankarikoira' title, or 'Hero Dog' honor, this year. Additionally, 17 other exceptional dogs will receive honorary mentions for their remarkable deeds. The Hero Dog title is a prestigious accolade given to dogs that have played a significant role in saving one or multiple human lives.
This year's list of heroic dogs includes a diverse range of breeds. Among the awardees are a labrador retriever named Alma, a Czech shepherd also named Alma, and a rottweiler called Vilma. The exploits of these dogs vary from sensing health emergencies to finding individuals in distress.
One such story is that of Dobermann Jedi. When Jedi's owner's partner experienced a dangerous dip in blood sugar levels, Jedi's persistent nudging alerted them, potentially preventing a tragic outcome. Similarly, Shetland sheepdog Lara, even at a young age, signaled her temporary caretaker about a life-threatening situation when the latter's husband had critically low blood sugar.
On a different note, a mixed-breed dog named Lenni became a savior for a memory-impaired elderly individual. Lenni detected the senior, who had wandered out into the cold with insufficient clothing, and promptly alerted their owner.
It's not just health emergencies where these dogs have showcased their valor. Several have also played crucial roles in locating missing or injured individuals. Labrador retriever Alma, for instance, discovered a person lying in the snow during a chilly winter walk, and Czech shepherd Alma alerted her owner to an individual who had fallen and lost consciousness due to a head injury.
Another heartening incident involves a golden retriever named Peppi, who was trained for search and rescue. When called upon to locate a missing elderly person as nightfall approached and temperatures dropped, Peppi successfully located the individual in a critical state.
The Finnish Kennel Club has been recognizing the heroic acts of dogs since the 1970s, but the formal title of 'Hero Dog' was first introduced in 1997. It's now a registered trademark of the Kennel Club, underscoring its significance in the canine community.
The award ceremony, scheduled for December, will be a significant highlight of the Dog Show in Helsinki. Agria Animal Insurance, a partner of the Kennel Club, will also be participating in the event.
The inspiring tales of these dogs not only emphasize the unparalleled connection between dogs and humans but also remind us of the limitless potential of our furry friends when it comes to compassion and action.''',

      title: 'Finnish Commerce Federation welcomes progress on digital euro',
      text: '''PREPARATORY WORK on the digital euro is continuing.
The European Central Bank (ECB) on Wednesday announced it will launch a two-year preparation phase in order to finalise the rules of, choose private-sector partners for, and conduct tests and experiments with the mooted digital currency.
“After two years, the governing council will decide whether to move to the next stage of preparations, to pave the way for the possible future issuance and roll-out of a digital euro,” the monetary authority stated.
The digital euro is discussed because the use of cash is on the decline, increasing the reliance of consumers and businesses alike on the two largest payment processing networks in the world, Visa and MasterCard.
“In Finland, only a small share of daily purchases are made with cash, and less than 10 per cent of people say they use cash as their primary payment method,” Tuomas Välimäki, a board member at the Bank of Finland, highlighted in a news release on Thursday. “As the use of cash declines, we have to make sure that households continue to be able to pay with central bank-issued money in a digitalising world.”
“Even though the variety of payment alternatives may seem great to us, payments have become very one-sided. I can naturally pay electronically with my card, using either debit or credit, or make a mobile payment with, for instance, ApplePay. Despite the apparent variety of alternatives, all of these payments would go through the same Visa or MasterCard channels.”
Välimäki argued that although the companies provide effective and reliable payment systems, it is crucial not to allow such a critical societal function to become monopolised.
“In payments, just like in other functions, the existence of alternatives both increases reliability and prevents prices from increasing,” he said.
He said the digital euro would be available to all eurozone citizens and should be usable in the same circumstances as cash – to make a payment at a shop or between individuals – but also in e-commerce and other circumstances where the payer and recipient are not within arm’s reach of each other.
The digital euro has also received some criticism, with the banking sector and regulators concerned about its impact on deposits in the commercial sector and, even, about a possible bank run in times of crisis, wrote Reuters on Wednesday. The ECB has sought to assuage the concerns by indicating it would impose a cap on how much an individual may have in digital euros – likely around 3,000 euros.
The Finnish Commerce Federation on Thursday welcomed news about the project moving forward, viewing that the digital euro is needed to promote competition and lower the cost of retail payments.
“It would be good if there was a European alternative to the international digital payment methods because increased competition would lower costs for retail companies and ultimately also for consumers. At the same time, it would strengthen security of supply in payments,” commented Simo Hiilamo, the head of advocacy at the Finnish Commerce Federation.
“We also consider it important that the online functionality of the payment method is featured strongly in the development work.”''',

          'Rome to grant honorary citizenship to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange',
      text:
          '''In a bold move symbolizing solidarity with those facing violations of fundamental rights, Rome has announced its intention to confer honorary citizenship upon Julian Assange, the embattled founder of WikiLeaks. The announcement was made by city councilor Antonella Melito on Tuesday, noting that the process will be finalized once the necessary documentation is in place.
Assange, currently 52 years old, remains imprisoned at London's high-security Belmarsh Prison. Since 2019, he has been contending against extradition to the US. There, he faces potential life imprisonment due to WikiLeaks' 2010 release of classified US Army intelligence associated with the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Melito underscored that through this symbolic gesture, Rome aims to project a message of unity and backing for individuals who are unjustly detained and condemned, infringing upon their essential rights.
This proposal to bestow honorary citizenship upon the Australian activist was initiated by Rome's former mayor, Virginia Raggi. Emphasizing the importance of this decision, Raggi took to social media, stating that this marked a significant move towards safeguarding both Julian Assange as an individual and as a representative symbol. She further stressed the paramount importance of persistently defending press freedom, drawing attention to Assange's predicament.
Interestingly, earlier this year, Stella, Assange's wife, had an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican. Reflecting on the encounter, she revealed to the Catholic Herald magazine that the Pope had extended a letter of support to her husband in March 2021. This gesture by Pope Francis provided a beacon of hope during a particularly challenging time for Assange, especially after a UK court's refusal to grant him bail, despite concerns over his prospective treatment in the US.
The drawn-out nature of Assange's detention has also elicited frustration from Australian officials. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese voiced his discontent in August over the absence of a diplomatic resolution for Assange's situation. He vowed to consistently urge the US to terminate their prosecution of Assange. This commitment stands even after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed Canberra's prior entreaties concerning Assange's welfare.
Albanese was candid with reporters, remarking, “This has persisted excessively. It's high time for a resolution.” He further reaffirmed Australia's unyielding stance and continued dedication to representing their views to the US administration.''',

          'Finnish youth turn to debt amid rising costs - many concerned about their ability to repay',
      text:
          '''Young Finnish citizens are taking on more debt to meet their daily expenses, and many are concerned about their ability to repay, according to a survey commissioned by OP Ryhmä. The research revealed that the financial burdens of those aged 16 to 25 have surged, with over half accruing additional debt in the past year.
A significant component of this youth debt stems from student loans, with 64% of respondents reporting they've taken such loans.
This trend aligns with broader observations: in 2022, the average student loan debt for OP's clients was around €10,000 per student, mirroring figures from Kela, the Finnish social security institution. This is a significant leap from 2010 when Kela's data indicated an average student loan amount of just over €5,000.
"While student debt is fundamentally considered 'good debt' that facilitates future goals, many young individuals are anxious about their financial trajectory, influenced partly by rising interest rates," stated Aki Gynther, head of personal banking at OP.
Credit card and consumer loan utilization among the youth remains consistent with past patterns. "Within the last year, there's been an uptick in young people's credit and consumer loans, mirroring the trend seen across our broader clientele. Payment defaults have also seen a modest rise," continued Gynther.
Despite the mounting debt, the belief in a brighter financial future among Finnish youth appears to be dwindling. Over one-fifth (21%) anticipate a worsening of their personal financial situations, while nearly a third (29%) predict a further increase in their indebtedness.
"Most young people feel they are currently managing their debt repayments well. However, almost a third are apprehensive about their capacity to continue doing so in the future," Gynther added.
Regarding credit card and consumer loan limits, the utilization rates among young people are lower than those of families and working-age individuals – a promising sign.
Furthermore, the survey shed light on young Finns' spending habits in relation to their income. November and December emerge as the months where expenditures are at their peak, often draining the savings accumulated throughout the year. "Broadly speaking, young people are not able to amass savings. On an annual scale, it appears that all earnings are spent," Gynther observed.
To mitigate their financial struggles, young Finns are seeking additional work. 22% have reported taking on more overtime in the past year, 10% have acquired a second job to cover rising expenses, and 20% have considered finding secondary employment. Another 17% have pondered taking on overtime in hopes of boosting their earnings.''',

          'Nokia to shed up to 14,000 jobs globally, including almost 450 in Finland',
      text:
          '''NOKIA on Thursday announced it will launch a sweeping cost-cutting programme to safeguard its profitability.
The Finnish network equipment manufacturer revealed it intends to lower its cost base by 800–1,200 million euros over a three-year period by reducing its global headcount by up to 14,000, a number equalling roughly 16 per cent of its staff of 86,000.
The company has seen its profitability erode primarily due to the market situation: as soaring interest rates have increased the financing costs of its clients, network operators have postponed investments in equipment upgrades. The decline in demand has prompted the company to seek cost savings primarily in mobile networks, cloud and network services, and corporate functions.
In Finland, Nokia intends to terminate 447 of its 6,800 jobs, although the number is subject to change depending on the consultative negotiations with staff representatives. No cost-cutting measures are to be implemented in its research and development functions in the country or its manufacturing operation in Oulu.
The exact scale of the programme will depend on market development and the consequent savings on inflation.
“The most difficult business decisions to make are the ones that impact our people,” stated Pekka Lundmark, the chief executive of Nokia. “We will support everyone affected by this process. Resetting the cost base is a necessary step to adjust to market uncertainty and to secure our long-term profitability and competitiveness.”
Nokia on Thursday reported that its profitability eroded beyond expectations in the third quarter of the year, its revenue contracting by 15 per cent year-on-year to 4.98 billion euros and comparable operating profit by 36 per cent to 424 million euros.
Analysts were expecting the company to post around 5.7 billion euros in revenue and 550 million euros in operating profit. The performance also gnawed away at the financial standing of the company, reducing its net cash position by 36 per cent year-on-year to 2.96 billion euros at the end of September.
Nokia also revealed that it plans to streamline its organisational structure and increase the autonomy of its four business divisions by embedding sales teams into the divisions.
Lundmark argued that the medium and long-term outlook remains bright due to the significant investments that are required in mobile networks to bring about the cloud computing and artificial intelligence revolutions.
“Outside China, only about a quarter of the cell towers in mobile networks have been upgraded to 5G frequencies,” he was quoted saying by YLE.
Because the timing of the market recovery remains uncertain, however, the company is taking decisive action on three levels: accelerating its strategy implementation, streamlining its operating model and resetting its cost base.
“I believe these actions will make us stronger and deliver significant value for our shareholders,” he stated.
Ericsson, the main rival of Nokia, viewed this week that the market will not begin to recover until next year.''',

This anticipated update was recently announced by Mark Zuckerberg, and according to TechCrunch, Android users will be among the first to experience it in the upcoming weeks.
With the hustle and bustle of modern life, many individuals juggle between personal and professional realms. WhatsApp's new feature promises a smoother transition between these spheres. "No more shuffling between two phones or fretting about sending a message from the wrong account," the company elucidated in a blog post.
However, there's a small catch. To activate this dual functionality, users will require two distinct phone numbers, necessitating either a secondary SIM card or a multi-SIM/eSIM-enabled device. The setup process is straightforward: navigate to WhatsApp settings, select the arrow adjacent to the user's name, and choose "Add account". The initial setup will require verification via the second phone or eSIM facility.
Moreover, WhatsApp has ensured that users can customize notifications and privacy settings independently for each account. Both beta testers and regular users can avail of this dual account feature, enhancing the overall messaging experience.''',

          '''A recent survey by the ifo Institute and the Institute for Swiss Economic Policy IWP indicates a silver lining in the global economic clouds, suggesting that worldwide inflation rates are set to dip over the coming years. The Economic Experts Survey, which pooled insights from specialists across 128 countries, anticipates the global inflation rate to drop from 6.2 percent this year to 5.2 percent in 2024 and further slide to 4.5 percent by 2026.
Several significant economies are echoing this trend. In the UK, inflation is anticipated to peak at 6.5 percent this year. Meanwhile, Ireland projects a rate of 5.6 percent, the US forecasts 4.2 percent, and Canada expects 4.1 percent. Niklas Potrafke, an ifo researcher, notes, "While the current inflation expectations remain elevated, they've considerably receded from the last quarter's figures."
The 2023 projections for inflation are notably subdued in Western Europe at 4.6 percent and North America at 4.1 percent, witnessing a quarter-over-quarter drop by 0.3 and 0.4 percentage points respectively. By 2026, these regions are projected to further temper their inflation rates, with Western Europe at 2.4 percent and North America at 2.7 percent.
Conversely, regions like South America and significant portions of Africa are bucking this trend, with much higher inflation expectations, notably a striking 20.5 percent in South America.
The survey, carried out between September 26 and October 11, 2023, drew perspectives from 1,541 global participants, painting a comprehensive picture of the global economic climate and its inflationary trends.''',

      text:
          '''Finland, known for its rich musical heritage, has witnessed a significant shift in its acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in music over the past few years. According to a recent study titled "Listening to music in Finland 2023", conducted by Teosto and Music Producers – IFPI Finland ry, the once skeptical Finnish audience seems to have warmed up to AI's role in music creation and presentation.
A few years back, AI's encroachment into the musical realm met resistance from Finns. However, the 2023 study reveals a softer stance, likely owing to AI's rapid progression in various sectors of daily life. But while technology may be making inroads, the human touch remains irreplaceable for many. Kari Tervonen from Omnicom Media Group, who led the study, remarked, "Even though AI has made strides, our findings show that Finns still champion the human factor in music."
Interestingly, the nation stands divided on the future of AI-driven music. While 37% don't foresee a surge in AI's role, almost a third believe its involvement will only grow. Most notably, 64% of all respondents and 46% of those aged between 13-25 opine that genuine music is exclusively human-made and performed. Over half voiced concerns regarding the livelihood of human artists in an AI-dominated industry. Yet, for those who play musical instruments, a significant 40% expressed interest in harnessing AI to reshape music.
The trend of AI reimagining songs is not just theoretical. Early in 2023, TikTok saw a wave where AI remodeled renowned tracks using vocals imitating other famous artists. This AI imitation trend became a staple, with Finnish content creators eagerly jumping onboard. When quizzed about their dream AI-music mashups, Finns' suggestions were both hilarious and intriguing. Some wanted a blend of local legend Irwin Goodman with the iconic British band Genesis, while others sought more intuitive combos like "Jimi Hendrix's rendition of 'Layla'."
Despite AI's growing prevalence, its interpretations remain somewhat basic in nuances, leaving the future of this trend a matter of speculation. "Determining the extent of AI's future impact remains a challenge," concludes Tervonen. As the world of AI and music intertwines in Finland, it will be fascinating to see how this harmonious relationship evolves.''',
